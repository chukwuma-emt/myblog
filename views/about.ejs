  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Chukwuma</strong> — a passionate web developer and computer scientist based in Nigeria. I specialize in building full-stack web applications using technologies like <strong>Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and EJS</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am the creator of <strong>EM_TECH</strong>, a personal blog and platform where I share tutorials, projects, and ideas focused on web development, business tech, and software design. I enjoy turning complex systems like POS (Point of Sale) apps, blog platforms, and hospital management systems into clean, modern, and functional web solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beyond building software, I love teaching others how to code, and I’m committed to helping beginners gain digital skills that can change their lives. I’ve created beginner-friendly training content, simplified complex web apps, and designed systems with real business needs in mind.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m currently working on several real-world systems including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>🛒 A full-featured POS (Point of Sale) system with cashier and store management</li>
    <li>🏥 A hospital management system (HMS) built from scratch using Node.js</li>
    <li>✍️ A multi-user blog with media upload, comments, likes, views, and admin control</li>
    <li>💻 Packaging web apps into desktop applications using Electron</li>
    <li>🌍 Deploying web apps on Contabo VPS with domain setup and Nginx</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    I enjoy solving real-world problems with code and building practical tools that empower businesses and individuals. If you're interested in collaboration, tutorials, or building your own system, feel free to reach out!
  </p>

  <p>
    Thanks for visiting my blog — I hope you learn something new or get inspired to build something amazing.
